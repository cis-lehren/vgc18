Madison Bumgarner just hit a bomb. His 3rd homer of the season. Other people with 3 this season: Matt Holliday Josh Hamilton Jon Luccroy
Hulk Hogan overheard the news of Back in Black's 25th anniversary and did a double take to ensure it wasn't another leaked sex tape of his.
It's time for Sharknado 3. We know how to live it up on Saturday night.
I like Sharknado but I don't like the April character
I just saw Floyd Mayweather at the Fashion show &amp; I was like "love you Money May!" &amp; he's like "thanks I appreciate you" lol

Ima just go catch a matinee of Ant-Man by myself tomorrow lol
Ant-Man feels like a rough 1st draft of the Marvel universe (namely Iron Man) which it probably was, considering it's where it all started.
Watched Ant-Man for the 3rd time for free, technically because it's with family. :)))

Ant-Man may have cliched and formulaic structure, but it's a whole lot of fun. The final 40 mins is superb.
Looking forward to going on @610CKTB tomorrow morning at 7:50 am to chat damage control for the iconic Hulk Hogan.
Finally getting a chance to watch Sharknado 3. I liked the 1st one a lot and loved the 2nd one, so I've really been looking forward to it.

@tomlennon @iamsteadman @probablydrunk I'm a dumb, the missus booked a sofa at the electric tomorrow for Ant-Man. Fancy it tomorrow?
The most exciting part of Paper Towns was the instrumental version of Fourth of July by Fall Out Boy that played in the middle of the movie

I'll end the streak of bad movies tomorrow when I go to Ant-Man again
Just saw the trailer for 12 rounds with Dean Ambrose. Yeah that September 11th is going to be good.
@blakersims no shit? he looks awesome. Randy Orton in the 2nd one made me uncomfortable.
I think the best Stan Lee cameo may be in Ant-Man. It had me laughing hard.
The 15 seconds of fame Ansel gets in Paper Towns may have been the best part....

Probably gonna watch Paper Towns next Tuesday since I have to go somewhere and the ticket is half price ^^
Can't overstate the importance of Kris Bryant's walk-off HR after being swept over the weekend and blowing a 3R lead in the 9th tonight.
So, Kris Bryant's HR not only may have saved the Cubs season, but may have unofficially led to this Tulo blockbuster.
Kris Bryant will make October 7th come faster don't worry everyone.

Still hyped rn! Kris Bryant is my favorite player, he got his 1st walk off homer, the Cubs got an important W and are staying in the hunt
I attended Tulo's final game in a Rockies uniform tonight. And witnessed a Kris Bryant walk-off homer. Not a bad Monday.

A happy fun loving Saturday 2 the wonderful @TaraReid true CHAMPION of Sharknado films an always shows the love 2 everyone across the world
@absoluteradio can you play some Iron Maiden for me while I'm stuck at work on a Saturday night!
Lavalantula is genuinely better than Pixels. I have laughed so may more times and not at it but with it. The guy from Sharknado showed up
@SurlyNurseJoy New Iron Maiden album on the 4th of September~ Has their longest eversong on it, which is why that reminded me.
It's the first of August and started off good with Ant-Man.
@MissWhit83 If you were told you were going to lose to Floyd Mayweather in the 5th round you'd be rightly concerned about the first 4 rounds
@CharlesHeffer Probs my 3rd fav old band, U2, VU and JA. The Smiths 4th. Nirvana in there too if you can count them
Honestly, I'm liking Kendrick's "Bad Blood" verses a lot more now. May be able to elevate the song to being really good to me.
Spent the last hour listening to Van Halen, can't believe I've not listened before! Tomorrow it will be Iron Maiden. Holiday tunes sorted.

It's the Saturday of a long weekend and I'm at home watching Sharknado. This is my new life.
The fact that Bailey is bringing Dunkin into work tomorrow, is the only thing keeping me motivated to wake up in the morning.
I feel like Brock Lesnar may be the only boyfriend that's safe dating Rousey.
everyone needs to watch the live streamed Sir Paul McCartney set @lollapalooza is showcasing tomorrow night. can't wait to reminisce.
Floyd Mayweather may be greatest boxer in the world right now but Ronda Rousey is the greatest fighter in the world
Who wants to go see Ant-Man tomorrow? I believe it's a film about a man who's imbued with all the powers of a guy named Anthony.
Watched Ant-Man for the 2nd time today, and thought of 2 more reasons to see it again: to catch the Easter eggs and catalog its Britishisms.

@MattSpiegel670 @JayZawaski670 Can confirm first-hand, Paul McCartney was fantastic on Friday night. Worth dealing with the human detritus.
December 5th could be the biggest UFC Card put together. Aldo &amp; McGregor, and Rousey as a co main event with her possibly fighting Cyborg.

Great game by David Price and the Blue Jays!!!! #Jays Loved that 4th inning!
Apart from the 4th inning mastery by David Price, the best part of the game was my boi Gregg Zaun going OFF on Yordano Ventura.
Wow. New Jay pitcher David Price comes as advertised. 8 innings, 11 strikeouts, 1st win as a Blue Jay! Bring it!

Oh just drinking a Westy on a Monday night listening to some Nirvana. #maternityleave http://t.co/MwO7RL8BCo
We had David Price 1st in our #FanDuel projections today. His 22 pts today ties him for 10th on the list of highest SP scores this season
my monday has consisted of Paul McCartney on a loop in my head and craving honey barbecue boneless wings with ranch from bdubs
@Caradelevingne @johngreen @natandalex I'm going to see Paper Towns for the second time tomorrow.I love this movie.(Love you Cara!)
If you're having doubts about Ant-Man, just go and see it, you won't be disappointed. He may not be a major character, but the movie is good
Looking forward to Monday Night Raw, the return of Brock Lesnar (and @HeymanHustle). #RAW
David Price's 1st win as a Jay! Incredible day at the ballpark!! http://t.co/MB2QbpPEUh

@Taybay_2012 wouldn't it be great if there was someone to bring us Dunkin tomorrow (cough) @NikMoore_
David Price is gonna be hellafun every 5th day.
July 4th is Independence day. And the day Chuck Norris was born. Coincidence? I think not.
Been on a huge Beatles binge since I heard Paul McCartney play this past Friday night. Even though I wasn't in the crowd, it was amazing.
So Adrian nearly has as many fantasy points for my team as David Price does. 35 for Adrian, 42.5 for Price. Still only the 7th. #Rangers
Great day for baseball. David Price kills it in his debut for the Jays and then the Braves walk off in the 12th. Love this game!!
Football update 7pm Scrimmage game v JCM Tuesday night at USJ. Rumor has it that Chuck Norris and Hulk Hogan will fight at halftime.
I just have a very strong connections with Paper Towns. Probably my 2nd favorite book of all time.
tomorrow will be the day I get up and go to dunkin in the morning I feel it
Just watched Sunday's Big Brother @CBSBigBrother James has the biggest balls #Wow #bigbrother @JohnjayVanEs @richberra @brittneycastle1

@JayCyde There are a few winks in WINTER SOLDIER and ANT-MAN, various IRON MANs. Largely, though, you may be right.
I first tweeted this in April or May, but John Kasich can win the GOP Primary.
John Kasich with the goal posts gesture needs to be on front pages tomorrow. It's a gift. Make me proud, headline writers.

That Kris Bryant 9th inning home run was the turning point in the season.
Stats flying around lately, but this is my favourite: Today is the 2nd game where Troy Tulowitzki and David Price play for the Blue Jays.
Naruto volume 70 from @VIZMedia ranks at #7, marking its 8th week on the New York Times Manga Bestsellers
Jason Aldean Thursday, free Toronto Blue Jays game Friday and ZBB concert Sunday. Bout to be the best weekend of summer.
Thought about seeing the new Fantastic Four movie today. Passed and saw Ant-Man for a 2nd time instead. LOL #AntMan #FantasticFour
Seeing Jason aldean for the 13th time today... Yup
Catching up on movies before they leave theaters. Trainwreck was as good as everyone says it is. Tomorrow, Ant-Man.
@smackalalala Currently 6-0 Top of the 9th. They got lucky trading for David Price. That's one ace of a pitcher to have in the lineup.
Ant-Man was even better the 2nd time
@Robbb11Roppp112 Article highlighted SS501 as one of the 3 top groups in the 2nd generation of KPop idol (fr 2005 onwards)

One of the advantages to living in SC is we get to meet candidates in person, going to meet Carly Fiorina tomorrow, a competent honest woman
Josh Hamilton was 4th on Rangers in Win Probability Added entering this game. He'll be 2nd by the end of the day. Just crazy.
@thedoctor2016 @japancuriosity @MangaUK I hope that they attract the right audience and some that may not have seen DBZ or Naruto before.
1st time watching Sharknado--too freaking funny! Luv the cast! Watching #3&amp; def will watch the 1st two! Gotta join Sharknado cult following!
Josh Hamilton can strike out 4 times but if bats in the 9th or later, he will win you the baseball game.
Josh Hamilton hit a two run homer in 2011 WS in the 10th with a sports hernia. If anyone with any decent fielding skills catches the ball...

Straight Outta Compton dragged a little in the 3rd act but was very good. Laughs, tears. And O'Shea Jackson Jr. WAS Ice Cube!

FYI, tomorrow = release date for the pumpkinnnn!!! Just called my local Dunkin. Can you say fiend?!
It would have been cool if Ice Cube was staring out of the window at his neighbor when they showed him writing Friday. #HeyMissParker
Straight Outta Compton's success hopefully convinces New Line Cinema to give Ice Cube the right budget for the last Friday movie.

Sheamus is going to win on Sunday since he was pinned by Randy Orton more than once since Battleground.
Can't wait to hear the huge pop for Brock Lesnar tonight, despite the fact that he's facing The Undertaker this Sunday. #RAW
Ice Cube one of the gods of nigga movies. He wrote Friday, Players Club, and All About the Benjamins, not to mention his acting credits
If you are a real MMA fan then UFC 194 will probably be the 2nd best card of the year I wouldn't put the Rousey card in the top 10
@dontbackdownANM Who do you have winning this Sunday? The Undertaker or Brock Lesnar
Seth Rollins promo has been better than the first two hours of Monday Night #RAW
As long as Seth Rollins leaves with his title Sunday night then I'll be happy #RAW #TitleForTitle
Seth rollins would have been a great champion if he does all things whatever he says every monday night on #raw in the middle of this ring
I hope that John Cena wins the wwe world heavyweight champion for the 16th time &amp; Seth Rollins is right the future is now. #titlefortitle
"Triple H was never Ric Flair's bitch......... This Sunday, Imma make you mines." - @JohnCena to Seth Rollins, lmao that was a great promo.

Tbh. Drag me down music video was so good that I didn't notice Zayn was missing until the 4th time I watched it
My hope is that John Cena fighting Seth Rollins this Sunday is a result of the whole Unexpected Cena meme that's been happening lately.
Zayn, i just wanna see you winning grammy on this very first debute album. C'mon, just introduce a new genre of music called Zop or Zquadom.
@JohnCena I hope you make history Sunday. Show Seth Rollins what being champion is all about http://t.co/VmJHfeMJ2T

Still can't believe there was a scene in Straight Outta Compton about Ice Cube writing Friday and saying, "This script is funny!"
Ice Cube's son O'Shea Jackson Jr may very well be the Denzel Washington of our generation. Dude is a beast
Congrats to @JohnCena on his 500th @MakeAWish. On Sunday he grants his 501st when he lets Seth Rollins pretend to be a main eventer #Kayfabe
If anyone wants to hook me up with dunkin on Thursday that would be fantastic- I'll even pay you
Terry Collins: "We are certainly right now ... expecting [David Wright] to be here Monday." That means the series opener in Philadelphia.
Friday afternoon trip to the mega liquor store is about as close to nirvana as a 30-something guy can get

Dave Grohl I may not be in the cities with you singing word for word to Foo Fighters songs right now but I'm there with you in spirit.

This nigga in Friday look like the guy who played Ice Cube in Straight Outta Compton
Saw Paper Towns again. Still perfect the 2nd time.
In the history of Tae Kwon Do, Chuck Norris was the first person from the West to be ranked a 8th Degree Black Belt Grand Master.
My review of "Straight Out of Compton" If you like Ice Cube, you may like his son better. plus "bye Felicia" makes even more sense B +

@dantencer mvp mvp. 11 pitchs and the 6th pitch to stay alive. He is going to get paid bigtime.and david price wow
To me, Zayn vs Neville last December was the definitive wrestling match, after tonight it's Bailey vs Sasha. High spots, false finishes..
I can't believe tomorrow im seeing the loml's again for the 3rd time but Zayn won't be there and I didn't even think about that.
@kaponofor3 Rousey and Stephanie may beat her to it but I know what you mean. She's a special talent.
@kateburning Well Moose is in luck, because tomorrow at WWE Summer Slam, Undertaker faces off with Brock Lesnar and omg I can't wait.
So I bet anyone money that tomorrow John Cena beats Rollins and Sheamus comes out and cashes in the money in the bank

Crew gets a fumble at the 4, Murray and the O can't punch it in. Kick a FG to make it 17-7. May be Murray's team now. Crew has been awesome.
WE HAVE THE BREAK ! Murray breaks Bellucci to 30. Serving for the 1st set at 5-3 !
Assuming Murray pulls it out here all 4 matches on Monday will be very intriguing.
Murray with another huge 1st down run, 26 yds
A lot has happened while I was away sprain-spraying my ankle. Murray has taken the 1st set 6-3 in 50 mins &amp; is up a break at 2-1 in the 2nd.
Don't forget to ask about your chance to go see Janet Jackson in Saskatoon on Monday. We've got tickets and they could be yours tonight!
Kyle Allen making it happen. The injury to Murray may have been a blessing in disguise. Aggies back up 10.
Everywhere I go by Janet Jackson ! ugh I remember waking up when it was still dark in the winter for school I think like 3rd grade
I like that Bellucci is making Murray work for it in this 3rd set! #usopen @usopen @ESPNTennis
@teamgabrod I like pumpkin muffins from Dunkin! Would Thursday or Friday be good for you??
Red Sox score eight in the 4th Where has this been all season?! These guys are having fun out there! http://t.co/NjI0C19SZs

1 set up and has already broken Murray in the 2nd. This is beautiful from Kevin
@DareToHart i'm not a huge fan myself but you know Murray will probably comeback in the 3rd &amp; 4th set knowing him.
@tgawd____ trash OL? Theyve looked excellent so far. Trash RBs?J-Stew ran for 486 yards in the final 5 games last season, 2nd only to Murray
Murray has this. He may not have it at the moment but I'm not worried #USOpen #murray
Super super super excited about gay pride on the 19th too mf hype.
Of the 2 Milton Keynes setlists the Foo Fighters played this past weekend, the Saturday was definitely the better one. Glad I was there
@notzeev IKR, gonna be me tomorrow night "Hi Costco, Naruto ready for work, believe it!"
What an effort from Murray in that 2nd set. Got to take the momentum from the last few games into the 3rd. #USOpen
My son's braden 8th birthday got money in the bank briefcase due to Seth Rollins. Can you say happy birthday seth rollins to my son?
Thursday will mark Tom Brady's 14th consecutive opening day start, the largest active streak in the NFL! http://t.co/DcyQ7M9NKL
David Wright really showed up in the 7th inning of the @Mets win today. Had the go-ahead RBI and a crucial run scored. Easy guy to root for.
There you go! Murray breaks back in the 3rd. Can he make another comeback here? Looooong way to go! #USOpen2015 #@usopen
Murray breaks again!! Back to back breaks in the 3rd set, Game face on!
@Joannalangfield Concerned. If Murray can win this 3rd set, I think/hope he can win the match :)
Just as I say how good Anderson has been, Murray goes 3-1 up in the 3rd. Of course. #USOpen
Yoga tomorrow at 7:30 pm at Illuminate! I can't wait to see you guys there!
I start school tomorrow and I'm only going because I don't want Nicki to be mad at me
15-30 on Murray's serve, but the Scot more up than down finally and grabs the hold of serve with a couple of aces. Andy up 4-3* 3rd set.
Really great match this now. Anderson is going for broke on every Murray 2nd serve, and Murray is winning most rally points now. #USOpen2015
Konta has started well, at least on her own serve. Murray has a big moment at 4-4 in the 3rd, down 2 sets. #USOpen
Murray does well to hold. 5-4 to Murray. Anderson to serve to stay in the 3rd set #USOpen
@BrainGameTennis If Murray takes 3rd set I think he'll win
Lets go Andy! Murray wins the 3rd set, down 1-2. #usopen #andymurray
Murray takes the 3rd set, game on!
Get in!! Murray take the 3rd!! (Anderson leads 7-6 6-3 6-7) #USOpen2015
We're going to a 4th set!! Murray just dominated that tiebreak, wins it 7-2. He's pumped up now!! #USOpen2015 #Murray
Murray stays alive! He wins the 3rd set 7-6! #USOpen #tennis
Come on @andy_murray!! Tempted to make my way across to Flushing Meadows on Wednesday if Murray comes back to win here! #USOpen
@SkySportsTennis the later i stay up the better...c'mon Murray!
@SkySportsTennis it's why I love tennis. One minute looks like murray is down and out. Next minute anything is possible! C'mon @andy_murray
Yoga can help your child concentrate at school. Research shows that the deep breathing exercises may improve children's focus.
@serialsockthief Definitely although I think if Murray does enough to win the 4th set he'll go on and win it.
Tomorrow kicks off 5$ class week! Come try out our NEW morning classes. Slow Burn Yoga with Barrett starts at 9:30 tomorrow am!

This Murray vs Anderson match is great. 4 hour match and it's still in the 4th set.
Biggest game of the match. Even bigger than the 3rd set tie-break. Murray simply had to hold. Please Andy.

Holy shit Murray &amp; Anderson have been battling for 4+ hours on Grandstand. Only the 4th set. #USOpen

@ACMI 2nd visit to David Bowie Is last night and I already feel like I should be going again! Absolutely amazing exhibition! Thank you! &lt;3
Away. Away. Away. Syndergaard peppering outside of the plate and then busts pitches inside. Thor has found his groove. 5K. Top 6th.
Regardless of what happens- Thor's recovery from the 1st and his middle innings here give me hope for the future #LGM #Mets
Finally home from all this so called shopping in time to see Thor Finish up the 6th
People who know baseball know Thor is the player of the game cause after the 2nd inning he started dealing and kept mets alive
Put it in the books! Big games for The Captain, Thor, and Granderson. Let's got Matz tomorrow! #LGM
Nice win, Thor, Captain America, and the Falcon came up big , let's even this up tomorrow. #LetsGoMets

What's nice about CY pitching tomorrow night, he won't lose focus like Ventura did after Thor singled. We can't go to a game 7 with YV
I want to dress up as Thor tomorrow and wear a Syndergaard jersey.
"I knew that Escobar attacks 1st pitches, so there you go, hit this one.." Thor is a real life hero. #LGM
I like how Thor is bragging about making Esky uncomfortable as if he didn't give up 6 hits and 3 runs in 1st 2 innings.
Thor is a throw back kind of pitcher. I love it!!!! https://t.co/EAm51LNbHR
I'm loving all these quotes from the cry baby Royals about Thor's 1st pitch to Escobar. If I'm Matz, I'm doing the same thing Saturday.
@Noahsyndergaard great game &amp; way to make a statement on the 1st pitch. Very Bob Gibson of u. Beware of Thor the hammer will come! #LGM
@mystery_butt i hope you're ready for March 24 because that's when i transmute into Dark Souls Danielle
